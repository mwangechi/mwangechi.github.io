## Elastic Stack

Elastic stack is  a collection of open source software tools - ElasticSearch, Logstash,beats and Kibana that are all developed managed and maintained by Elastic. 




**ElasticSearch**: stores the logs

**Logstash**: for both shipping, processing and storing logs

**Beats**: lightweight, fast data shippers and collectors

**Kibana**: for visualization and management of the stack



It is designed to allow users to take logs from any source, in any format, and to search, analyze, and visualize that data in real time. The main advantage of the Elastic stack is that it provides for centralised logging that is useful in identifying problems with servers or applications and allows you to search all your logs in a single place. It also helps to find issues that occur in multiple servers by connecting their logs during a specific time frame.
